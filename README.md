**Abstract**
Winnerless competition (WLC) is a framework for sequential switching, observed
from low- to high-dimensional settings, in which units alternate in transient dominance
through competitive, state-dependent interactions. Instead of converging to
a fixed point or limit cycle, the system transitions continuously through states in
which different units temporarily control the dynamics. This mechanism enables
reproducible yet flexible activity patterns, relevant to sensory–motor encoding in biological
networks. We investigate WLC in a discrete-time setting using a network of
non-chaotic Rulkov maps, designed to emulate key features of neuronal membrane dynamics,
including quiescence, isolated spikes, and bursts. The resulting three-neuron
Rulkov network (3NRN), coupled via a conductance-based potential mediating excitation
or inhibition, is subjected to an exhaustive exploration of its multidimensional
parameter space. Our analysis reveals robust sequential dynamics that support
WLC-like dynamics, characterized by sequential switching and the absence of
global winners. We introduce WLC maps as phase-space visualizations linking these
regimes to motion-encoding patterns inspired by the locomotor repertoire of Clione
limacina. Perturbation analysis under spontaneous, momentary, and sustained disturbances
demonstrates that these regimes exhibit resilience and preserve coding
integrity, suggesting potential utility in noisy environments. These findings highlight
how low-dimensional, discrete-time neuron models can serve as tractable platforms
for investigating sequential dynamics at the intersection of nonlinear dynamics, network
theory, and biologically inspired computation. Our results show that robust
WLC dynamics can emerge in compact, analytically accessible map-based networks,
offering a promising framework for bioinspired coding, neuromorphic architectures,
and autonomous agent control.
